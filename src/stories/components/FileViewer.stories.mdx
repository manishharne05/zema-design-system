# FileViewer

###  FileViewer is a component that allows you to preview or download a file.
---
<br />

## When to use:
- When it is necessary to present an image to the user, allowing them to view it without having to download it.
- When it is necessary to present a file to the user and allow them to download it.
- To present previews of image files before downloading.
- When the user needs to quickly review a file without opening a separate application.

<br />

## When not to use:
- When it is more convenient for the user to see the image directly without having to click on the component. In this case, use the Image component.
- When the content does not require interactivity, such as a simple icon or a thumbnail without additional functionality.
- For very large files that may take time to load in preview. In this case, only provide the download option.
- When previewing may compromise the security or privacy of the data contained in the file.

<br />

## Comments:
Only files with extensions _png_, _jpg_, _jpeg_ and _webp_ will have the preview generated. Only files with extensions _png_, _jpg_, _jpeg_ and _webp_ will have the preview generated.
