# Elevation

Elevation tokens are used to indicate the positioning of the various 
interface elements on the Z axis, dividing the components into layers. 
By default, all components are arranged on the same layer.

<br />

## Recommendations

- Elevation tokens were created by imagining their use in reference 
components (backdrop, toolbar, modal, etc.). Avoid using tokens in 
"component classes" that are very different from those for which they were designed.

## Comments
- Hovering over the example illustration in the table will show the comparison of tokens and their elevation levels.

## Tokens
Elevation tokens are scss variables and are described below.
<br />

export const Template = (args) => ({
	setup() {
		return { args };
	},
	components: { Elevation },
	template:`<elevation />`,
});

<Story name="elevation">
	{ Template.bind({}) }
</Story>
